    ******************   IMPORTANT DETAILS   *********************
In the package.json we used ("type": "module") at the bottom of the script.
This allows us to ESM as our module system, so that way we can use the modern
import/export statements, instead of having to use "require()" to import
modules. Because we are using ESM we must change the file extensions of 
the start up scripts from .js to .mjs (represents the latest ways of import and exporting modules)
